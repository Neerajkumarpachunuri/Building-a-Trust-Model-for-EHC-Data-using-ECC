# Building-a-Trust-Model-for-EHC-Data-using-ECC
## Project Overview

This project implements a **CSV encryption tool** using **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**. It allows you to securely encrypt the contents of a CSV file by leveraging ECC with the SECP256k1 curve, ensuring data protection during storage or transmission. It is built using Python and the `ecdsa` library.

### How It Works:
- **Public and Private Key Generation**: Uses the SECP256k1 elliptic curve to generate a secure key pair.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypts the contents of each row in the CSV by converting them into numerical values and using ECC point multiplication for encryption.
- **Data Decryption**: Can decrypt the encrypted file using the corresponding private key.

This project demonstrates the power of elliptic curve cryptography for securing data while maintaining efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets.

## Features

- **Elliptic Curve Encryption**: Uses ECC, a more secure and faster alternative to traditional RSA encryption.
- **CSV Data Protection**: Encrypts sensitive data in CSV format to ensure confidentiality.
- **Error Handling**: Identifies and handles rows that fail to encrypt, ensuring smooth processing of large datasets.
- **Key Management**: Supports PEM format for public and private key handling, making it easy to integrate with existing cryptographic systems.

## How to Use

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install ecdsa
## Future Enhancements

- **Decryption Module**: Implement a decryption function to reverse the encrypted CSV back into its original form.
- **Key Management System**: Integrate a key storage and management solution to securely handle keys.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhance the performance for handling very large datasets efficiently.
- **User Interface**: Create a simple GUI to allow non-technical users to encrypt and decrypt CSV files with ease.
- **Cloud Integration**: Expand the tool to work seamlessly with cloud storage services to encrypt/decrypt data stored in the cloud.

## Use Cases

- **Secure Data Storage**: Protect sensitive data stored in CSV files, such as financial data and personal records.
- **Data Transmission**: Safely transmit encrypted CSV data over networks, ensuring it remains secure from unauthorized access.
- **Cloud Security**: Integrate encryption with cloud workflows to ensure that data is protected before being uploaded.
